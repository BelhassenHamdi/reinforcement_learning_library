# reinforcement_learning_library
This repository contains some function and tools issued from the reading of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction from Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. As long as I am reading the book, I will try to implement the different functions from the book to make a whole library of reinforcement learning. I will manage to make two seperate versions, one using python and the second using golang. Feel free to participate and help making this happen.
